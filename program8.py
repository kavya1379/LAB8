# --- Main Program Execution ---

# 1. Create a Python program that takes a list of numbers (Sample List)
# Based on the expected output (Even numbers: 6, Odd numbers: 6, Prime numbers: 3),
# here is a list that will produce those counts.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

# Another list, if the problem intended a different one, for testing:
# my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30] # 3 Even, 6 Odd, 4 Prime

# 2. Analyze the list
results = analyze_numbers(my_list)

# 3. Expected Output (Print the results)
